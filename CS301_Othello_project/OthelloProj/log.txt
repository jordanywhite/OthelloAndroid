Problem: Unsure of how to design our own button/text view layout
Resources: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3496269/how-to-put-a-border-around-an-android-textview
		   http://blog.vogella.com/2011/07/19/android-shapes/
Solution: Create an xml file, in the drawable folder and specify shape, background/border color, border width,
		  and corner shapes/sizes. After you create this drawable, we changed the background of the text views to
		  the drawable we created.

Problem: We wanted to use bitmaps to draw our board and game pieces, but were unsure how to.
Resources: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9979789/drawing-bitmaps-in-android
Solution: We used static methods from the BitmapFactory class to create bitmaps and then we used Bitmap.createScaledBitmap()
		  and g.drawBitmap() methods to resize our bitmaps and draw them on the canvas. The solutions we used can be found in the OthelloHumanPlayer
		  class in the setAsGui() method and the tick() method.

Problem: We wanted to create a dialog box after the user presses our "Quit" button
  		 to allow the user to confirm they wish to quit, or to cancel and resume playing.
Resources: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12600360/how-to-make-an-alert-dialog-box-in-android
   		   http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlertDialog.html
Solution: We were pointed to the "AlertDialog" class, which we looked up and used to create a pop-up box with
   		  a positive and a negative button. This code is used in OthelloHumanPlayer class in the "quitPressed()" method.
